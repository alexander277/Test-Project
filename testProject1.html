		<h3>Water Chemistry</h3>
		<p>African cichlids typically like to be kept in warmer water temperatures, around 78-82 degrees. They also like hard water, generally with a high kh and gh, and require a ph of at least 7.8-8. If your ph or kh is naturally low in your area, you can supplement this easily by adding crushed coral as substrate or in your filter.</p>
		<h3>Compatibility</h3>
		<p>There are three types of african cichlids, mbuna, peacocks, and haps. Typically peacocks and haps get along just fine and can be mixed without issue, but mbunas are generally recommended to be kept by themselves and not mixed with the other two types. The reason for this is that mbuna are generally more aggressive, and like to swim in and out of rock structures. This is quite the contrast for peacocks and haps as they are open swimmers, and as such prefer an open water tank with little to no decor. There aren't many fish that make good tank mates for african cichlids, but one that is typically done successfully is synodontis species of catfish. They are found in the same area and have compatible water parameters, as well as being able to hold their own against the cichlid's agressive tendencies.</p>
		<h3>Agression & Overstocking</h3>
		<p>As prior mentioned, african cichlids are quite aggressive. It is generally recommended to overstock them to help reduce aggression, as when is a crowded tank it's hard to target and bully a single fish. This practically eliminates a single fish being stressed and possibly killed due to aggression. The rule of thumb commonly used is to take the number of gallons your aquarium is and divide that number by 2, and that is how many can be kept. Keep in mind if you do overstock your tank this will lead to your nitrites going up much quicker, requiring much larger and more frequent water changes. It isn't uncommon to do a 75% water change or two 50% water changes weekly.</p>
